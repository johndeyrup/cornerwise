* Running the Server

  We're using Docker (and eventually docker-compose), because it ensures
  that we're all working with the same environment. In essence, Docker
  is a tool for managing lightweight Linux machines.

  If you follow the instructions below, you will have the necessary
  dependencies, including Postgres w/GIS extensions and Django 1.8.

** Docker Installation

   You'll only need to run this once. Docker Toolbox is a prerequisite
   of both the easy instructions and the full instructions below.

   - [[https://www.docker.com/toolbox][Install Docker Toolbox]]
     - The Toolbox includes VirtualBox and Docker Machine.

** Easy Start (OS X or Linux)

   This is the recommended way to start the server, unless you need
   more fine-grained control.

  - ~cd path/to/cornerwise~
  - ~./start.sh~

    The script will detect if you have Docker Toolbox installed. If you
    do not, it will find the latest version and download it. Toolbox
    includes Docker, VirtualBox, and other required utilities. Once you
    have completed the installation process for Toolbox, rerun the start
    script. It may take a while, especially if this is the first time
    you've used Docker.

  - Once you're running inside the container (you should see a prompt
    beginning with root@[some id]), you can start the server by typing:

    ~sh /app/start.sh~

    Django should start.

  - The easy start script will try by default to remap ports from the
    virtual machine to localhost, so you should be able to browse to
    http://localhost:3000 (or another port, if you've configured it). If
    that fails, you can determine the IP address of the VM by opening a
    new terminal window and typing ~docker-machine ip dev~.

*** Additional Features

     For full usage details of the easy start script, type
     ~./start.sh -h~

** Full Instructions

*** Docker Machine

    Docker Machine comes Docker Toolbox. It lets you configure different
    machines, real and virtual, on which to deploy your containers. For
    the purposes of testing and development, we'll be using the
    VirtualBox driver.

**** Initial Setup

     You'll only need to run this once, after you've installed Docker
     Toolbox.

     - ~docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev~

       Creates a new machine with the name 'dev'. This may take a minute
       or two; it has to fetch boot2docker.iso, a stripped-down VM
       image.

*** Run

    - ~eval $(docker-machine env dev)~
    
    For Windows: docker-machine env --shell=powershell dev
    Run the command that says run this command to configure your shell should be something like:
    docker-machine.exe env --shell=powershell dev | Invoke-Expression

      This sets up some environment variables to allow the ~docker~
      command line client to communicate with the ~dev~ machine.

    - ~docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/server:/app -v $PWD/client:/client -v $PWD/data:/data APP_PORT=3000 APP_NAME=cornerwise -p "3000:3000" bdsand/cornerwise /bin/bash~
    
    On Windows:
    docker run -it -p "3000:3000" bdsand/cornerwise /bin/bash

      Creates a new /container/ from the 'bdsand/cornerwise' /image/,
      which it will fetch from Docker Hub if it's not present on the
      local machine. Exposes the 'server' directory as /app inside the
      container. Maps the container's port 3000 to port 3000 on the
      virtual machine. Sets APP_PORT and APP_NAME environment variables,
      which are used by the Django start script. Runs ~/bin/bash~ within
      the new container.

      If you have never run this before, it will need to download the
      image, which includes (among other things) Python 3, PostGIS,
      Redis, and GDAL utilities. It weighs in at a few hundred MB.

    - *You should see a bash prompt.*

      If you see an error that says something like:

         ~Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?~

      Run: ~eval $(docker-machine env dev)~

      And try the ~docker~ command again.

    - ~sh /app/start.sh~

      Bash script to start the server. It starts Postgres and then
      Django.

*** Opening in Browser
    - (OS X) Quick way: ~open http://$(docker-machine ip dev):3000~
    - (Linux) If you have xdg-open installed: ~xdg-open http://$(docker-machine ip dev):3000~

      Running ~docker-machine ip dev)~ will print out the IP address of
      the 'dev' machine. In our case, this is a VirtualBox VM. Because
      the VM does not forward its ports to the host (i.e., your
      computer) by default, you must connect to it using the IP address.

*** VM Port Forwarding
    - If you're using VirtualBox, you can set it up to forward, e.g., its port 3000 to your computer's port 3000 by running:

    ~VBoxManage controlvm dev natpf1 "django,tcp,127.0.0.1,3000,,3000"~

    "django" can be any name you choose. The first '3000' is the host
    port. The second '3000' is the VM port. These do not have to be the
    same.

    - For additional details, see the [[http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html][VirtualBox manual]].

* Additional Notes

  - An image creates a snapshot of a machine. When you start a container from an image, you're starting clean. Changes you make to unshared folders (including--for now--Postgres data) will not be persisted on the image. When you stop the container, the data will be lost. This is acceptable for us while we stabilize the models, etc.

* Troubleshooting
  - If the script hangs while fetching a new image (~Using default tag:
    latest~), or if url fetches hang inside the container, it may be an
    issue with the VM's networking. I'm not sure exactly what causes it,
    but you can fix it by running ~docker-machine restart dev~ in a
    fresh terminal window.
